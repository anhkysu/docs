> # 1. 12 PRICIPLES OF AGILE PROJECT:

- ## The **highest priority** is to **satisfy the customer** through `early and continuous delivery`

- ## **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development

- ## **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months

- ## `Stakeholders` and `developers` must **collaborate** on a daily basis

- ## Build projects `around motivated individuals`. Give them the environment and **support** they need, and **trust** them to get the job done.

- ## **Face-to-face meetings** are deemed the most efficient and effective format for project success

- ## A **final working product** is the `ultimate measure of progress`

- ## Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- ## **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design** enhances agility

- ## Simplicity— **maximizing the work not done** —is an essential element

- ## The `best architectures, requirements, and designs` _emerge from self-organizing teams_

- ## At `regular intervals`, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then **tunes and adjusts** its behavior accordingly

> # 2. Agile might be a big departure from how your company or your teammates are used to working. It means `moving quickly`, which means `not everything will be spelled out or planned beforehand`. Therefore, you need to know whether or not your environment can handle this kind of change.

## 1. Are you willing to start a project without knowing where you’ll end up?

You know that saying `‘fail fast?’` It refers to Agile project management. With Agile, you’re moving quickly and continually testing with real users. Which `can be super stressful` if you’re a control freak (kẻ cầu toàn muốn kiếm soát mọi thứ).

Before you adopt Agile, ask yourself how comfortable you are with `putting out a less-than-finished version of your product for users to test`? Do you feel good about launching an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or do you think your project needs to be fully baked before it can see the light of day?

## 2. How risk-averse (né tránh rủi ro) are you?

Like we said before, Agile is all about continuously `deploying and learning from your mistakes`. Which means you’re potentially `taking on a higher level of risk than you would` if you went with a more traditional project management style.

Is your culture a `fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants` startup where risk is your middle name? Or are you standing on the precipice of failure and need to make sure everything goes perfect right away (which, if we’re being honest, never happens)? If you’re going the Agile route, you’d better be prepared to take on any unknown issues that come up along the way.

## 3. How flexible is your team?

In Agile, you work with your customers to make the product better. But `this doesn’t always fly with designers, developers, and makers of all kinds with an` **ego** (i.e. all of us). `Ask yourself if your key players can put their ego aside` and adjust their efforts and ideas based on customer needs.

## 4. How strict is your company hierarchy?

One of the key principles of Agile is `not only to work with your users`, but that developers will `have access to key stakeholders` on a daily basis. For some companies, this is a stretch. What is your culture like? Is there a hard set hierarchy in place or will those at the time gladly be a part of the development process?

## 5. How do you measure progress? And success?

Shiny new object syndrome and Agile don’t mix. Agile project management is all about working to continuously refine your processes and better your product. So, `if you’re more likely to just run off after the next exciting idea` and leave the last one to flounder, `you’re not going to get` the best results that Agile has to offer. Take a minute to look at how you and your culture define progress and success. Can you see that small, steady steps get you closer to your end goal?

> # 3. Agile is a mix of `constant planning`, `execution`, `learning`, and `iteration`, but a basic Agile project can be broken down into these 7 steps:

- ## Step 1: Set your **vision** with a strategy meeting

At the beginning of a new Agile project, you need to **define a clear business need or vision** that your project is addressing. In essence, you need to answer why you’re doing what you’re setting out to do? **It’s big picture stuff, but this is the core belief** that you’ll refer back to as you build.

For product companies, one of the best ways to define your vision is to use what’s called the **Elevator Pitch**:

- For: (Our Target Customer)
- Who: (Statement of the Need)
- The: (Product Name) is a (Product Category)
- That: (Key Product Benefit, Compelling Reason to Buy and/or Use)
- Unlike: (Primary Competitive Alternative)
- Our Product: (Final Statement of Primary Differentiation)

(_How long should it take?_
_This is totally subjective, but a proper strategy meeting can take anywhere from 4–16 hours (just not in a row!)_)

- ## Step 2: Build out your **product roadmap**

Once your strategy has been validated it’s time for the product owner to translate that vision into a product roadmap. This is a high-level view of the requirements for your project with a `loose timeframe` for when you will develop each of them.

```
“Goal-oriented roadmaps focus on goals, objectives, and outcomes like acquiring customers, increasing engagement, and removing technical debt. Features still exist, but they are derived from the goals and should be used sparingly. Use no more than three to five features per goal, as a rule of thumb.”
```

For each of these goals, you want to include 5 key pieces of information: Date, Name, Goal, Features, and Metrics

- ## Step 3: Get amped up with a **release plan**

At this stage, the product owner creates a high-level timetable for the release of working software. Because Agile projects will have multiple releases, you’ll want to prioritize the features needed to get you to launch first.

- ## Step 4: Move from the **macro to the micro** view

It’s time to move from the macro to the micro view as the product owner and development team plan `“sprints”`—`short cycles of development in which specific tasks and goals will be carried out`. A typical sprint lasts between 1–4 weeks and should remain the same length throughout the entire project as this enables teams to plan future work more accurately based on their past performance.

- ## Step 5: Keep your team on track with **daily standups**

Throughout every sprint you need opportunities to make sure no roadblocks are creeping up and getting in the way of completing your goals on time. That’s where the daily meeting, or “Standup” in Agile-speak, comes in.

A standup is a daily, 15-minute meeting where your team comes together to discuss three things:

- What did you complete yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Are there any roadblocks getting in the way?

- ## Step 6: Sprint’s done? It’s time for a review

If everything has gone as planned, by the end of your sprint cycle you should have a functioning piece of software. At this point, it’s time to review what was done and show this off to people on your team and any key stakeholders. Think of it as `Agile show-and-tell`.

The key here is to check your initial plan to make sure that all requirements were met. As the product owner, it’s your choice to accept or refuse certain functionalities. If something went wrong, ask why? How can you adjust the next sprint so your team can hit their targets? Agile is all about continuous learning and iterations, and this means on your processes as well as your product.

- ## Step 7: What’s next? Decide what to focus on in your sprint retrospective

For Agile project management to work, you need to have `a clear next step after each step`.

This is determined during your sprint retrospective. Once a sprint has been completed and features have been shown off, it’s time to decide what work gets done next. Did you learn something during the sprint that changes your initial timeline or vision for the project?

Don’t simply plan, but also take this time to discuss how the previous sprint went and how you could improve in your next one.

> # 4. How to implement Agile: The top 3 Agile methodologies explained

Agile is more of a blanket term for a philosophy of project management and development.
To use these ideas to their fullest, some very smart people have developed Agile methodologies you can follow.

## 1. Scrum

With Scrum, the “Product Owner” works closely with their team to identify and prioritize their goals or features and add these to what’s called a “Product Backlog”. The backlog can consist of features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements—pretty much anything that needs to be done in order to deliver working software.
With this backlog in place, the Product Owner decides priorities and teams sign up to deliver “potentially shippable increments” of software during their Sprints, which typically last 30 days. Once the team has committed to that Sprint’s backlog, nothing else can be added to it except by the team. At the end of that 30-day Sprint, the backlog is analyzed and reprioritized (if necessary) and the whole thing starts over.

## 2. Kanban

Visualize your workflow on a ‘board’
Being able to see all the items you’re working on in context of each other can be incredibly informative and help keep things clear and simple when projects get complex. Kanban tools (like Planio!) use a ‘board’ style to see all your items and where they fit in the flow from to-do to doing to done.

![KANBAN METHODOLOGY](https://plan.io/images/blog/kanban-agile-task-board.png?1591881564)

Have clear next steps
To keep the flow of Kanban moving, you should always know what happens next after an item is finished. This means keeping your backlog prioritized and updated.

## 3. Extreme Programming (XP)

The original XP ‘recipe’ described by software engineer Kent Beck, was based around 4 values—simplicity, communication, feedback, and courage—with 12 supporting practices.
