> Horizontal integration is an action where a company acquires another company that is essentially doing the same thing, e.g. when a biscuit company decides to buy another biscuit company. This type of integration is the type that you would see when one company is looking to develop some type of monopolistic advantage by reducing competition and increasing market share in order to develop specific economies of scale.

> Vertical integration is when a company that operates within one section of the overall supply chain acquires another company within that same supply chain, e.g. when a biscuit company decides to buy the trucking company that distributes the biscuits to retailers or decides to buy the company that provides the raw ingredients for the biscuits. This type of integration is the type you would see when one company is looking to cut overall costs and potentially even speed up the entire supply chain (or at least tailor the activities of the trucking company or the raw ingredient company to their own specific requirements).
