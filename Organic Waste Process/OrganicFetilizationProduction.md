# How to compost food waste?

1.Find or buy a compost bin and then place it in your yard and make sure it will get plenty pf sunlight throughout the day as heat is essential for the decomposing process.
2.Add your food waste such as vegetables, fruits, breads, coffee grounds and filters,etc. to your compost bin.
3.Add water to your compost bin. Compost should always be moist but not soaking wet. If you use water from tap, let it set for 24 hours to get rid of chlorine and other chemicals that will kill beneficial microbes in your compost.
4.Use a pitch fork or other long-handled garden tool to turn compost at least once a month. If you have a tumbling compost bin, you should turn once a week to speed up process of decomposition.
5.When compost is ready for use, it will be a dark,rich-looking soil with a clean, earthy smell. Composting can take from 2 weeks to 6 months, it depends on the type of compost bin you have.

> The above we discussed is only suitable for individuals, we can do it at our own home. It has many limitations, also, the process is long. If you want to turn food waste into valuable organic fertilizer quickly to make profits, we will recommend you the next following organic fertilizer production process by using food waste.

# The organic fertilizer production process whole process mainly consists of steps, including mixing & crushing, composting, granulation, drying & cooling, screening and packaging.

1.Food Waste composting
The first step is composting, it is the basic process. Food waste fermentation process plays the preliminary but indispensable role in the whole organic fertilizer production process. Composting can convert food waste into hygienic, humus-rich,relatively stable product that conditions soils and nourishes plants. It also leads to reduction in odor and the removal of pathogens.
The hydraulic compost turner can accelerate fermentation speed and prevents generation of poisonous and smelly gas.

2.Food Waste Crushing
There are various kinds of food waste, such as fruits, vegetables, leftovers,etc, after composting completed, they should be shredded into small particles. High moisture raw material crusher machine is commonly applied machine here. All food waste is put into the crushing chamber and be crushed. It can handle a huge variety of food waste in a short period of time and rip apart a food waste into smaller pieces. Moreover, it can grind all kinds food waste efficiently and quickly.

3.Granulation Process
After the fermentation process is finished, the compost can be sent to granulator for further production organic fertilizer. Granulating process is the vital important part in the whole process, so choose a suitable fertilizer granulator is very important.
Here we suggest you new type organic fertilizer granulator. By using the mechanical stirring force of high speed rotation and the resultant aerodynamic force, the organic materials can realize continuous mixing, granulation, spheroidization and densification in the machine, so as to achieve the granulating purpose.

4.Organic Fertilizer Drying & Cooling Procedure
The next is drying and cooling process, organic fertilizer drying and cooling usually can be combined together. After granulating, the organic granules are often with high moisture and heat, for making better quality organic fertilizer, the content of them should be reduced to a certain percentage.
Rotary drum fertilizer dryer is used to dry organic fertilizer granules and after drying, the moisture content can be decreased to 10%. And about organic fertilizer granules cooling, fertilizer rotary drum cooler will help remove the heat for granules. Granules enter from the inlet and cooling air enter from outlet join adversely. The fertilizers of low temperature will be discharged through outlet after transferring the heat to the cooling air. It can greatly improve cooling rate.

5.Organic Fertilizer Screening and Packaging
After drying and cooling, there are some granules that do not meet the quality requirements, so they need to be reprocessed before packaging to ensure the uniformity of the finished product. Rotary drum screening machine can separate the finished product and returning materials. It can also be used for classifying the finished product.
After all these completed, the last procedure is packaging. Full automatic packaging machine is used for automatic quantitative packaging of organic fertilizer granular. It will save labor force and complete packaging with high efficiency.
